	Big time loss with a bug caused by wrong TILE_SIZE

	Figured out the logic for sliding left. Not sure if 2 2 2 2 should turn into 4 4 0 0, or 8 0 0 0. Also both 4 2 8 0 and 2 4 8 0 are valid for 2 2 2 8. Time to see gameplay determine behavior.

	Took a break and finding out how to do all four sliding movements with one function was difficult. Tested it also, because it has a lot of edge cases.

	Play testing! But also then found a bug, will rewrite the update function to be robust...

	Back at it now, give me a few seconds to git push and fix that bug from earlier...

	I had finished earlier but played until I was able to overflow the 2048 block. Really fun game.
